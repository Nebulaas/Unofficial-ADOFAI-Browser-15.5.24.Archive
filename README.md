Unofficial (Not endorsed by either TUF or 7thBeatGames) Custom Level Browser, Built using Electron, Vite and Typescript.

----------

As of 15/5/24, I am archiving this repository as I have built a newer codebase with react, built from a different template and therefore fixing and clearing this repository just to replace everything would be more effort than it would be worth. 

You can find the new repository here: https://github.com/Nebulaas/Unofficial-ADOFAI-Browser
